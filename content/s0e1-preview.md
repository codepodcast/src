Hi guys, super-excited to spread a bit of rumor around first episode of code podcast. 
In first post it was claimed that beautiful patterns are present in completely different environments and episode 0 will be so much more about it. 
Episode 0 main topic is concurrency. Oh yes, what can be more exciting than that? You`ll hear about threads, loops, processes, green threads and there will be several guests that we are not yet unveiling, but these will be mega-awesome folks that you do not want to miss.
